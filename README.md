# Social-Network-API

## About the Project

The Social Network API is run by invoking the command node index in the terminal. Once the server is started, you are able to create users, users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. We use MongoDB because of its speed in its ability to process large amounts of data, as well as its flexibility with unstructured data.
